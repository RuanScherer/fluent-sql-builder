# Fluent SQL Builder

## Overview
This is an application that simulate a SQL builder. The purpose of this application is to give me knowledge about builder model and TDD (Test-Driven Development). I didn't create a real use of the created class because I just wanted to analyze its behavior and test the operation, and all of this was done only with the jest tests.
